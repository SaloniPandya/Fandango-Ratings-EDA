# Fandango Rating Exploratory Data Analysis
Back in 2015, FiveThirtyEight published an article entitled "Be Suspicious Of Online Movie Ratings, Especially Fandangoâ€™s". The article concluded that Fandango tends to overrate thier movies. In other words, the number of stars that the website shows for a certain movie is often higher than the true rating for the same movie.
Our goal is to validate these results through a detailed EDA for the given data set.

To that end, the Analysis consists of two main parts:
  Exploring Fandango Displayed Scores versus True User Ratings
  Comparison of Fandango Ratings to Other Sites
