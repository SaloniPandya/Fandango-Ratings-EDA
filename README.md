# EDA-of-Fandango-ratings-
If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?
The goal is to check if Fandango's ratings had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets.
